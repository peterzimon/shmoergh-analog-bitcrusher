# Shm√∏ergh Analog Bitcrusher

Analog bitcrusher with variable downsampling between about 100Hz and ~20kHz rate 
and wet/dry control. Note that this is a fully analog unit, no coding involved. 
KiCad version: 5.x but theoretically should work on 6.x.

Simulations are made with [CircuitJS](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html)
